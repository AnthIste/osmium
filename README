Database setup
==============

Only PostgreSQL is supported. You must have a database with two
schemas, one named "eve" that contains the static data dump of the EVE
database, the other one named "osmium" (use the osmium.sql file to
create it).

Caveats
=======

Make sure the "cache" directory is writeable by your http user.

If you are NOT using the Apache HTTP Server, you will have to adapt
the rules in the .htaccess file.

Dependencies
============

* PHP >= 5.3 with:
    PostgreSQL extension,
    cURL extension,
    SimpleXML support.

* PostgreSQL >= 9.0
